# My Digimon API Site
I have built a responsive website that will showcase all of Digimon's data using Javascript to fetch data from API. This website is user friendly and is compatible with mobile device of any size.
 
# The purpose of this Site.
This website serves to provide Digimon Data retrieved using API via Javascript and display them in a neat and orderly manner for users. User can also search for their favourite digimon character using only the digimon's name. In general, it is a website cathered to Digimon's fan.

# Design Process
The design is simple and elegant. The color scheme used in this theme is light yellow and the reason this color was chosen is because it does not draw attention away from the content while providing comfort and warmth to the eyes of the user. The content is layout in an attractive way, no image or text is too large or too small, it is just nice for the user to see everything without having to zoom in or out.
