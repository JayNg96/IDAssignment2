# My AnimeDex Site
I have built a responsive website that will showcase anime's game data, but for now, only Digimon and Pokemon are implemented. This website uses Javascript to fetch data from API server. This website is user friendly and is compatible with mobile device of any size.

# The purpose of this Site.
This website serves to provide anime game data retrieved using API via Javascript and display them in a neat and orderly manner for users. User can also search for their favourite character using the search box provided in both page. This is especially useful for user who plays an anime game and need the information to assist them.

# Design Process
Due to the lack of anime game wiki implemented in the internet, this website is implemented to provide game information to not just an anime game, but every anime game that existed. With this website, user has access to every anime games data with just a few clicks or taps on their screen. Hence, this eliminate issues faced by anime video gamer who are not able to find the character information they need.

The design is simple and elegant. The color scheme used in this theme is relative to the anime's color theme. Digimon's main color theme is blue and yellow while pokemon main color theme is red and white(Pokeball). The color variant is carefully chosen so that it does not draw users' attention away from the content while providing comfort and warmth to the eyes of the user. The content is layout in an attractive way, no image or text is too large or too small, it is just nice for the user to see everything without having to zoom in or out.
