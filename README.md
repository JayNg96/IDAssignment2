# My Digimon API Site
I have built a responsive website that will showcase all of Digimon and Pokemon's data using Javascript to fetch data from API. This website is user friendly and is compatible with mobile device of any size.

# The purpose of this Site.
This website serves to provide Digimon Data and Pokemon Data retrieved using API via Javascript and display them in a neat and orderly manner for users. User can also search for their favourite character using the search box provided in both page.

# Design Process
The design is simple and elegant. The color scheme used in this theme is relative to the anime's theme. Digimon's main theme color is blue and yellow while pokemon is red and white(Pokeball). The color variant chosen does not draw attention away from the content while providing comfort and warmth to the eyes of the user. The content is layout in an attractive way, no image or text is too large or too small, it is just nice for the user to see everything without having to zoom in or out.
